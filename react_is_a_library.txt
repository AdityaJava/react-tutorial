Framework vs Library (with React Example)

1. What is a Framework?
- A framework provides a complete structure for building applications.
- It decides how your application should be built – with predefined rules, architecture, and flows.
- You call the framework’s code, but it also calls your code when needed (Inversion of Control).

Examples: Angular, Spring Boot, Django.

2. What is a Library?
- A library is a collection of reusable code you can use in your application.
- You control the flow – you decide when and where to use the library.
- Libraries are focused on specific tasks, not full application architecture.

Examples: React, Lodash, jQuery.

3. Why is React a Library, not a Framework?
- React focuses only on building UI (component-based rendering).
- It doesn’t dictate architecture (routing, state management, API handling – you choose which libraries to use like React Router, Redux, Axios).
- You call React to render UI – React doesn’t control the flow of your entire application.

4. Key Difference in One Line
- Framework = It calls you (complete structure, inversion of control).
- Library = You call it (flexible, pick and choose).
