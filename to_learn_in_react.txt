1. Core of react (state or UI manipulation, JSX)
2. component Reusability
3. Reusing of component (Props)
4. How to propagate change (Hooks). Like useState()

Additional addon to React
1. Router (React don't have router). React is SPA (Single page application) but we need to have /profile,
   /about so in this case we do some manipulations. We do this with readt-router-dom which is separate library
2. State management (React don’t have state management)
   -> Redux, Redux toolkit, Zustand, context API
3. Class based component 
   -> Legacy code
4. BAAS applications
  -> Social media clone, e-commerce application
